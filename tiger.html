          Tiger There are two recognized subspecies of tiger*: the continental
          (Panthera tigris tigris) and the Sunda (Panthera tigris sondaica). The
          largest of all the Asian big cats, tigers rely primarily on sight and
          sound rather than smell for hunting. They typically hunt alone and
          stalk prey. A tiger can consume more than 80 pounds of meat at one
          time. On average, tigers give birth to two to four cubs every two
          years. If all the cubs in one litter die, a second litter may be
          produced within five months. Tigers generally gain independence at
          around two years of age and attain sexual maturity at age three or
          four for females and four or five years for males. Juvenile mortality
          is high, howeverâ€”about half of all cubs do not survive more than two
          years. Tigers have been known to reach up to 20 years of age in the
          wild.
