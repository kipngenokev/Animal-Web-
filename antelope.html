          What is an antelope? Antelopes are hoofed mammals with hollow horns
          commonly mistaken for deer. The name ‘antelope’ is a catch-all term
          for many species in the Bovidae family. Still, scientifically, the
          only ‘true antelopes’ are the members of the Gazella, Nanger,
          Eudorcas, and Antilope genera. Other groups called antelopes include
          the subfamily Aepycerotinae, of which the near threatened saiga is the
          only living member, and the subfamily Acelaphinae, which includes the
          wildebeest. Antelopes come in a staggering range of shapes and sizes,
          with some built for pure speed and others for agility. The largest
          antelope (the giant eland) can stand as tall as 182 centimetres (six
          feet), while the smallest (the royal antelope) is only 25 centimetres
          (10 inches) tall. Some are coloured for camouflage so they can hide in
          their environment, while others have revealing patterns that help them
          stay visible to their herd.
