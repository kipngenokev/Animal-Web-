          What are rhinos? Rhinos may look like prehistoric creatures, and they
          do date back millions of years to the Miocene era, but they are also
          mammals like us. There are two species of African rhinos, the white
          rhino and black rhino, and each is distinct in its own way. The white,
          or square-lipped, rhino derives its name from the Dutch word “weit,”
          meaning wide. It is actually gray in color and has a hump on its neck
          and a long face. The black, or hooked-lipped, rhino has a thick,
          hairless gray hide. Both rhinos have two horns. Conservation
