          It is the second-largest living big cat after the tiger. Males are
          unique among the cat species for their thick mane of brown or black
          hair encircling their head and neck. The mane darkens with age, and
          the thicker and darker a mane is the healthier the cat. Both males and
          females roar â€” a sound heard as far as 8 kilometers away.
